```bash
Could not run rust-analyzer

Make sure the rust-analyzer binary is installed and in $PATH.
```


```bash
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
```

Add below in `Cargo.toml`

```rust
diesel = { version = "1.4.4", features = ["postgres"] }
dotenv = "0.15.0"
```

```bash
diesel setup
```

Above command creates `migrations` folder with inial set of `migrations`

```bash
âœ— ls migrations
00000000000000_diesel_initial_setup
```

### Create new table
```bash
diesel migration generate create_activities
```

### Running your migration

***migrations/2021-08-20-124342_create_activities/up.sql***
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS activities (
  id uuid DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  owner_id uuid NOT NULL,
  enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)
```

If case if you are using `UUID` for storing identifier you need to enable extension
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

```

***migrations/2021-08-20-124342_create_activities/down.sql***
```
DROP table activities;
```

### Redo your migration
This will revert your migration and re-run your migration again.

```bash
diesel migration redo
```

### Use uuid in Struct fields
Update your `Cargo.toml` for adding `uuid` library

```rust
[dependencies]
uuid = "0.8"
```


### Make your struct Query-able
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Queryable)]
struct Activity {
    name: String,
    description: String
}
```
By adding `Queryable`, It will generate code for Querying through struct.


### schema.rs
`schema.rs` file will be generated when you executed `diesel setup`. This schema file represents all table and columns which we are using as part of this project.

Below is format of `schema.rs`
```
table! {
    activities (id) {
        id -> Uuid,
        name -> Varchar,
        description -> Varchar,
        owner_id -> Uuid,
        enabled -> Bool,
    }
}
```

Note: Order of columns of schema.rs and order of struct fields should be same.
