My majority of my experience is with Ruby, even though I have hands on with Node.js, PHP, Python and Java.

I have always worked with Object oriented paradigm. I love to work with different programing language, This time I chose Functional paradigm.

Even ruby, Python or Java gives you way to write Functional way, But you might not able to write full functional code over there. Or library you chose will not allow you to write functional code as well.

So I started to put effort in learning FP this year.

1. I have chosen Clojure as my preference due to below reasons:
	1. I have little understanding about JVM architecture.
	2. Due to it's lisp style coding.

2. I have started reading book called **Clojure for Brave and True**
3. Sharing my learning clojure experience in [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/sathia.s/learning-clojure)
4. Written CLI application in clojure. You can find [here](https://gitlab.com/sathia.s/jira).
5. Attended clojure conference in Pune, India. (This is my first self sponsored conference, Lol)

## These are few progress in Clojure learnings.
1. Code as Data - Concept and philosophy from Clojure
2. Writing Pure functional, What is side-effects?
3. Data structures in Clojures
4. Namespaces in Clojures
5. What is persistence data structure?
6. Why Lazy-seq are important?

Still there are lot of things to learn
